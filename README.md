# Gramvaani Speech Recognition

This project aims to explore automatic speech recognition (ASR) techniques on the Gramvaani dataset using two different ASR models: OpenAI Whisper and IndicWhisper. The Gramvaani dataset consists of audio recordings in Indian languages, making it a valuable resource for research in speech recognition for Indian languages.

## Introduction

Speech recognition is a challenging task, particularly for languages with diverse phonetics and accents like those found in India. This project evaluates the performance of two state-of-the-art ASR models, OpenAI Whisper and IndicWhisper, on a subset of the Gramvaani dataset.

## Setup

### Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

- OpenAI Whisper: Install via pip using `pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git`
- ASR Evaluation: Install via pip using `pip install asr-evaluation`

### Dataset

The Gramvaani dataset is used in this project. You can download it from [this link](https://objectstore.e2enetworks.net/indic-asr-public/indicwhisper/vistaar/gramvaani.zip) and extract it into the `gramvaani` directory.

## Usage

### OpenAI Whisper

The notebook `OpenAI_Whisper_Inference.ipynb` covers the inference using the OpenAI Whisper model. It transcribes audio files from the Gramvaani dataset and evaluates the performance using the ASR Evaluation module.

### IndicWhisper

The notebook `IndicWhisper_Inference.ipynb` demonstrates the inference using the IndicWhisper model. Similar to the OpenAI Whisper notebook, it transcribes audio files and evaluates the performance.

## Results

The performance of both models is compared based on Word Error Rate (WER), Word Recognition Rate (WRR), and Sentence Error Rate (SER). The results indicate that IndicWhisper outperforms OpenAI Whisper, showing a significant decrease in WER.

## Evaluation

The ASR Evaluation module is utilized to calculate WER, WRR, and SER. Transcriptions generated by the models are compared with the original transcriptions provided in the dataset.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the effectiveness of state-of-the-art ASR models, particularly in the context of Indian languages. The findings contribute to the advancement of speech recognition technology for multilingual and diverse linguistic landscapes.
